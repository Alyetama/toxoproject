			<h2>About us:</h2>		
		<p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>is a parasite that infects many animals<em>.  </em>In the US, 18–80% of cats and 17–29% of humans are infected.  Cats play a unique role in its spread, as the parasite’s sexual reproduction can only occur in cats. </p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Most infected animals remain healthy.  However, infections in immunocompromised individuals or fetuses can be deadly. So, it is important to understand the role of cats in spreading the parasite. </p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Curiously, the parasite alters the behavior of otherwise healthy rats: <em>Toxoplasma gondii </em>infection affects the innate-fear response in rats and induces a fatal sexual attraction toward the scent of cat to make them more easily captured as prey by cats.  This influences how the parasite spreads between rats and cats.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Our research wants to address whether the parasite also alters a cat’s behavior to influence how the parasite spreads between cats. </p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Our research enlists the help of owners of indoor and indoor-outdoor house cats.  About 30% of pet cats are infected with the parasite already. By studying a large group of pet cats, we won’t need to infect any cat with the parasite.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Since knowledge of the parasite influence pet-owner practices, we will also work with cat owners to identify misconceptions about <em>T. gondii</em> infection and develop strategies to reduce infection in domestic cats. </p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Overall, our work aims understand whether chronic infection affects a cat’s well being.</p>

			<h5>bring your cat to our cat-behavior lab at uno</h5><p>We will ask you to bring your cat to the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha where we will study its behavior.  We will observe and record your cat's behavior after it wanders within a room with scented materials. During this assessment, you will be able to watch your cat's response using a live video feed in some trials and interact with it in other trials.</p>

		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions*:</h2><p><strong> </strong></p><pre><strong>Why are you being asked to be in this research study?</strong></pre><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">You are being asked to be in the study because you are an adult (19 years of age or older) and you own a cat that is over twelve months old, non-pregnant and, up to date on all rabies and other vaccinations.</p><pre><strong>What is the reason for doing this research study?</strong></pre><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">A common parasite found all over the world called Toxoplasma gondii is transmitted through cats. This study is designed to help address misconceptions cat-owners have about this parasite, and investigate whether cats who are exposed to this parasite modify their behavior.</p><pre><strong>What will be done during this research study?</strong></pre><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Initial Survey (approx. 10 minutes)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">We will ask you to complete an online survey to evaluate your understanding of cat Toxoplasmosis. After you complete the survey, we will ask you if you would like to help us evaluate your cat's behavior. There are four different assessments for this. You can participate in as many of them as you wish.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Behavioral Assessment 1 (approx. 10 minutes)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">In this assessment, we will ask you to answer a series of questions about your cat that will help us understand his or her personality.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Behavioral Assessment 2 (30 minutes)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">In this assessment, we will ask you to bring your cat to the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha where we will study its behavior. We understand that you will only be able to do this if you live near Omaha. In this assessment, we will observe and record your cat's behavior after she or he wanders within a room with scented materials. During this assessment, you will be able to watch your cat's response using a live video feed.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Behavioral Assessment 3 (approx. 5 minutes to install the collar on the cat)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">In this assessment, we will track where your cat goes when he or she leaves your house. We will show you how to place a lightweight tracking device on your cat's collar to record their behavior. We also will show you how to download the data the device records to our website. You will be able to view where your cat goes by looking at the data on this website.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Behavioral Assessment 4 (5 minutes to install the camera; less than one minute to record events)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">In this assessment, we will ask you to record some features of your cat's behavior in your house. We will arrange for you to have access to online questionnaires to help you record some of your cat's behavior. We will also ask you to make video recordings of your cat's behavior with your smartphone or a camera we provide and then upload them to our website.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Blood Sampling (5 minutes)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">In order to understand your cat's behavior in relation to whether it has been previously exposed to Toxoplasma gondii, we will ask you to let us obtain a blood sample from your cat. We will also use this blood sample to measure your cat's stress level, and to isolate your cat's DNA. This will let us understand more about how your cat's behavior is related to its stress level and its genetic make-up. </p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">There are two options for us to obtain your cat's blood sample. One is for you to let our vet-tech draw it when you bring your cat to one of our study sites. The other option is for you to ask your local veterinarian to draw it during your cat's regular check-up or vaccination.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Post-Participation Survey (approx. 10 minutes)</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">After two weeks of participating in one or all of this research's assessments, we will ask you to complete a second online survey. This may help us understand your thoughts about this research. It may also help us understand whether participating in this research has altered your views about your cat's behavior and your knowledge of cat Toxoplasmosis.</p><pre style=""padding-left: 40px;""><strong>What are the possible risks of being in this research study?</strong></pre><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Initial Survey</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">There are no known risks posed to you or your cat by taking the initial survey.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Behavioral Assessment 1</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">There are no known risks posed to you by answering questions about your cat's personality.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Behavioral Assessment 2</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">If you handle your cat when we study your cat's behavior, there is a risk of you being scratched, bitten, or exposed to pathogens that your cat already has.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">To minimize this risk, we ask that you not handle your cat during our observations and secure your cat in its carrier at all times while on the UNO campus, except for when it is released into the study-room by the researcher.</p><p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">You may experience some emotional distress while bringing your cat from home to the UNO campus.

		<h3><strong>What will be done during this study?</strong></h3>We ask you to bring your cat to UNO campus (Allwine Hall, room 240), where we will study its behavior.  We will observe and record your cat's behavior after it wanders within a room with scented materials.  During this assessment, you will be able to watch your cat's response using a live video feed in some trials and interact with it in other trials. Then in order to understand your cat’s behavior in relation to whether it has been previously exposed to <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, we will ask you to let us obtain a blood sample from your cat.  We will also use this blood sample to measure your cat’s stress level, and to isolate your cat’s DNA.  This will let us understand more about how your cat’s behavior is related to its stress level and its genetic make-up.  Your visit should take around <b>30-45 minutes</b>.
